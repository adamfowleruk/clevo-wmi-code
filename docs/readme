Right now this only supports the kbled stuff.

KBLED:

BUG: Sometimes you have to hit the fn-backlight disable key once or twice to make things work

left/middle/right works by setting a binary value XYZ where X is green, Y is red, and Z is blue

all_off: write a 1 to turn off the backlight

brightness: accepts 0-10 where 10 also enables the use of the fn keys

fade: fades the colors you set in and out. accepts a speed 0-3 where 0 is off, 3 is fastest

left_right, random, random_flicker, single_fade, out_mid: 1 turns on these paterns

pattern_off: 1 turns off any pattern and returns to previously user set colors

random_fade: fades random color in and out. XYY X is speed 0-3 and YY is the number
    of times to repeat that color. I just use 301 for this value.
